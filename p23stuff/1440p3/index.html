              <h2>background</h2>
                <p>The oceans are so vast and deep that until fairly recently, it was widely assumed that no matter how much trash and chemicals humans dumped into them, the effects would be negligible.</p>
                <p>Today, we need look no further than the New Jersey-size dead zone that forms each summer in the Gulf of Mexico, or the thousand-mile-wide belt of plastic trash in the northern Pacific Ocean to see that this early “policy” placed a once flourishing ocean ecosystem on the brink of collapse.</p>
                <p>Marine pollution is a growing problem in today’s world. Our ocean is being flooded with two main types of pollution: chemicals and trash.</p>

              <h2>plastic waste</h2>
                <p>Marine trash encompasses all manufactured products—most of them plastic—that end up in the ocean.</p>
                <p>Littering, storm winds, and poor waste management all contribute to the accumulation of this debris, 80 percent of which comes from sources on land. Common types of marine debris include various plastic items like shopping bags and beverage bottles, along with cigarette butts, bottle caps, food wrappers, and fishing gear.</p>
                <p>Plastic waste is particularly problematic as a pollutant because it is so long-lasting. Plastic items can take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>

              <h2>chemical contamination</h2>
                <p>Chemical contamination, or nutrient pollution, is concerning for health, environmental, and economic reasons.</p>
                <p>This type of pollution occurs when human activities, notably the use of fertilizer on farms, lead to the runoff of chemicals into waterways that ultimately flow into the ocean. The increased concentration of chemicals, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the coastal ocean promotes the growth of algal blooms, which can be toxic to wildlife and harmful to humans.</p>
                <p>The negative effects on health and the environment caused by algal blooms  hurt local fishing and tourism industries.</p>

              <h2>solutions</h2>
                <p>Solutions for marine pollution include prevention and cleanup. Disposable and single-use plastic is abundantly used in today’s society, from shopping bags to shipping packaging to plastic bottles. Changing society’s approach to plastic use will be a long and economically challenging process.</p>
