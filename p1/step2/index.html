    <p>Here is no water but only rock<br>
        Rock and no water and the sandy road<br>
        The road winding above among the mountains<br>
        Which are mountains of rock without water<br>
        If there were water we should stop and drink<br>
        Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think<br>
        Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand<br>
        If there were only water amongst the rock<br>
        Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit<br>
        Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit<br>
        There is not even silence in the mountains<br>
        But dry sterile thunder without rain<br>
        There is not even solitude in the mountains<br>
        But red sullen faces sneer and snarl<br>
        From doors of mudcracked houses<br>
