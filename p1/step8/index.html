    <p>Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves<br>
      Waited for rain, while the black clouds<br>
      Gathered far distant, over Himavant.<br>
      The jungle crouched, humped in silence.<br>
      Then spoke the thunder<br>
      DA<br>
      Datta: <a href="../step9/index.html">what have we given?</a><br>
      My friend, blood shaking my heart<br>
      The awful daring of a momentâ€™s surrender<br>
      Which an age of prudence can never retract<br>
      By this, and this only, we have existed<br>
      Which is not to be found in our obituaries<br>
      Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider<br>
      Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor<br>
      In our empty rooms<br>
      DA<br>
      Dayadhvam: I have heard the key<br>
      Turn in the door once and turn once only<br>
      We think of the key, each in his prison<br>
      Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br>
      Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours<br>
      Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br>
      DA<br>
      Damyata: The boat responded<br>
      Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br>
      The sea was calm, your heart would have responded<br>
      Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br>
      To controlling hands</p>
