    <p>A woman drew her long black hair out tight<br>
      And fiddled whisper music on those strings<br>
      And bats with baby faces in the violet light<br>
      Whistled, and <a href="../step7/index.html" class="class1">beat their wings</a><br>
      And crawled head downward down a blackened wall<br>
      And upside down in air were towers<br>
      Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours<br>
      And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.</p>
