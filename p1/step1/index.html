    <p> After the torchlight red on sweaty faces<br>
        After the frosty silence in the gardens<br>
        After the agony in stony places<br>
        The shouting and the crying<br>
        Prison and palace and reverberation<br>
        Of <a href="../step2/index.html" class="class1">thunder of spring</a> over distant mountains<br>
        He who was living is now dead<br>
        We who were living are now dying<br>
        With a little patience</p>
