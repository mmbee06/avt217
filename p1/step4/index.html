    <p>Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br>
When I count, there are only you and I together<br>
But when I look ahead up the white road<br>
There is always another one walking beside you<br>
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, <a href="../step5/index.html">hooded</a><br>
I do not know whether a man or a woman<br>
â€”But who is that on the other side of you?</p>
