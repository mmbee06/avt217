    <p> And no rock<br>
   If there were rock<br>
   And also water<br>
   And water<br>
   A spring<br>
   A pool among the rock<br>
   If there were the sound of water only<br>
   Not the cicada<br>
   And <a href="../step4/index.html">dry grass singing</a><br>
   But sound of water over a rock<br>
   Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees<br>
   Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop<br>
   But there is no water</p>
